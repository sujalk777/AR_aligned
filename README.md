# AR_aligned

**AR_aligned** is an experimental project exploring the integration of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) technologies using Unity and Python. The repository includes a Unity-based AR/VR interface and a Jupyter Notebook for data processing and visualization.

## Features

- **Unity Integration**: Unity scenes (`unity.jpg`, `unity2.jpg`) demonstrate AR/VR environments.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: `ARVR.ipynb` contains Python code for data analysis and visualization related to AR/VR applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Unity Hub with Unity Editor installed
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sujalk777/AR_aligned.git
   cd AR_aligned
   ```

2. **Set up Python environment**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Open Unity project**:

   Open the Unity project in Unity Hub to explore and run the AR/VR scenes.

4. **Run Jupyter Notebook**:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook ARVR.ipynb
   ```
